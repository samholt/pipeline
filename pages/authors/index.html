  <h2>Why Publish in Distill?</h2>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Flexibility</b> -- We do not expect you to conform to traditional academic style. The goal should be to best serve your readers.</li>

  <li><b>Impact</b> -- Distill articles are read by tens of thousands of people.</li>

  <li><b>Validation</b> -- Publication in Distill is external validation that your work is a serious academic publication, even if it is an non-traditional.</li>

  <li><b>Neutrality</b> -- Distill provides a neutral platform for multiple authors to jointly publish. This is in contrast to a personal blog, where it may feel like the outside contributor gets less credit.</li>

  <li><b>Archiving</b> -- Distill articles are issued DOIs and archived to ensure preservation of the academic record.</li>

  </ul>

  <h2>How to Submit an Article</h2>

  <p>Our preferred process is that you create a github repository with your article. If it is private, please share it with <a href="https://github.com/shancarter">@colah</a> and <a href="https://github.com/shancarter">@shancarter</a>. Then email <a href="mailto:review@distill.pub">review@distill.pub</a> to begin the process. Please contact us if you require alternative accommodations.</p>

  <p>Distill articles must be prepared using our lightweight web framework -- see our <a href="distill.pub/guide/">guide</a>. Articles must also be released under the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/">Creative Commons Attribution license</a>.</p>

  <h2>Article Review</h2>

  <p>Publication in Distill is a request for hundreds of thousands of people to pay attention to your work. As such, we believe the criteria for publication should be whether your article respects that attention.</p>

  <p><b>What we review for --</b> Distill reviews for outstanding communication, scientific integrity, and respect for prior work. We do not review for novelty or importance of results, but we will review for whether it moves the research dialog forward.</p>

  <p><b>Peer Review --</b> Distill discretionally uses pre-publication review by external experts, because it has a high cost on everyone involved. We facilitate post-publication review which we think does a better job accomplishing the goals of review.</p>

  <p><b>Editorial Support --</b> Distill's editors sometimes help authors improve promising articles. They can give feedback on exposition and help refine the design of diagrams. Authors tell us that their articles were greatly improved by this editing. That said, this kind of editing is expensive, and we do not commit to doing it for every article we consider.</p>

  <p><b>Review of Editor Articles --</b> In cases where editors are authors of an article, an uninvolved reviewer is required.</p>

  <h2>Authorship</h2>

  <p>The authors should be the set of people who made substantial contributions. This includes, but is not limited to, people who ran experiments, who formulated ideas, who wrote the actual article, or who created visualizations of ideas in the article. We encourage authors to include an “Author Contributions” statement.</p>

  <p>The one exception is that journal editors may make significant contributions in revising the article and not be authors.</p>

  <h2>Ethics Concerns (eg. Plagiarism, Misconduct, etc.)</h2>

  <p>Distill takes ethics concerns very seriously. Please email <a href="mailto:ethics@distill.pub">ethics@distill.pub</a> to raise a concern, or reach out to any of Distill's editors individually if that feels more comfortable.</p>

  <p>As a young journal, Distill does not have established policies or procedures for every issue we may run into. As issues arise we’ll give consideration to the policies of journals we respect (eg. <a href="https://www.plos.org/">PLOS</a>), the recommendations of the <a href="http://publicationethics.org/">Committee on Publication Ethics</a>, community norms, and the philosophy of the Open Science movement.</p>
