  <h2>Writing a Distill Article</h2>

  <p>Distill articles are prepared in HTML using the Distill infrastructure -- see the  <a href="http://distill.pub/guide/">getting started guide</a> for details. The infrastructure provides nice default styling and standard academic features while preserving the flexibility of the web.</p>

  <p>Distill articles must be released under the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/">Creative Commons Attribution license</a>. Distill is a primary publication and will not publish content which is identical or substantially similar to content published elsewhere.</p>

  <p>To submit an article, first create a GitHub repository for your article. You can keep it private during the review process if you would like -- just share it with <a href="https://github.com/colah">@colah</a> and <a href="https://github.com/shancarter">@shancarter</a>. Then email <a href="mailto:review@distill.pub">review@distill.pub</a> to begin the process.</p>

  <p>Distill handles all reviews and editing through GitHub issues. Upon publication, the repository is made public and transferred to the <a href="https://github.com/distillpub">@distillpub</a> organization for preservation. This means that reviews of published work are always public. It is at the author's discretion whether they share reviews of unpublished work.</p>


  <h2>The Distill Review Process</h2>

  <!--p>Academic review is a trade-off between lots of interests. Costs are paid by the editors, the reviewers, and even the authors. The situation is further complicated by the fact that most review service is a chore, reluctantly done out of a sense of obligation.

  <p>As a young journal treading into new ground, Distill doesn’t know what the best way to handle review is. Instead of committing to a detailed policy a priori, we commit to taking the interests of all parties extremely seriously and continually seeking the best compromise.

  <p>In general, we expect this to mean publishing a smaller number of articles and working very hard to handle those well.-->
  <!--<p> We divide our review process into two stages. A faster initial review narrows down articles to a smaller number for us to focus on, saving all parties time. These two stages are supplemented by the possibility of further post-publication review by interested parties through GitHub issues.-->

  <p>The first two stages of review are led by an editor. The editor will bring in external peer reviewers based on their discretion as to what perspectives are needed, optimizing for high-quality review and an excellent review experience for all parties. The amount of time these stages take is highly variable depending on how responsive the authors are.</p>

  <p>For all publications, Distill will review for outstanding communication and design, in addition scientific quality and integrity. Distill provides expert editing to help authors improve their writing and diagrams. While our review process does take time and energy, we strive to ensure it is well worth your effort.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>In the third stage of review, readers can raise new concerns through github issues. The issues will be moderated by Distill's moderators. Significant issues may be displayed in the article margin if the author does not address them.</p>

  <p>Distill may occasionally publish editorials, commentary, and invited content without peer review. This content will be clearly marked. Articles published prior to March 20, 2017 were informally reviewed without an official policy on how to do so.</p>

  <p><i>Distill's review policy is still developing and we expect to learn a great deal as we review papers. We will publish a more detailed, revised version of this policy by March 2018.</i></p>

  <h2>Conflicts of Interest</h2>

  <p>Distill editors can not be involved in the review process for a paper on which they are an author or where they are unable to be objective. If no editors are available to review an article, a member of the steering committee may lead the review process or have someone independent do so.</p>

  <p>Machine learning is a small field and Distill's editors will inevitably have prior relationships with some authors. Such relationships must be disclosed in the review process.</p>

  <h2>Ethics Concerns (eg. Plagiarism, Misconduct, etc.)</h2>

  <p>If you have any concern, please email <a href="mailto:ethics@distill.pub">ethics@distill.pub</a>. You can also reach out to Distill's editors or steering committee members individually if that feels more comfortable.</p>

  <p>Distill is still establishing policies and procedures. As issues arise we’ll consult with the community and give consideration to the policies of journals we respect (eg. <a href="https://www.plos.org/">PLOS</a>), the recommendations of the <a href="http://publicationethics.org/">Committee on Publication Ethics</a>, community norms, and the philosophy of the Open Science movement.</p>







<!--

  <p><b>Flexibility</b> -- We do not expect you to conform to traditional academic style. The goal should be to best serve your readers.</p>

  <p><b>Validation</b> -- Publication in Distill is external validation that your work is a serious academic publication, even if it is an non-traditional. Distill is registered as a journal with the Library of Congress and CrossRef. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="doi">ISSN: <a href="https://lccn.loc.gov/2017201669">2476-0757</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;DOI: <a href="http://doi.org/10.23915/distill">http://doi.org/10.23915/distill</a></span></p>

  <p><b>Neutrality</b> -- Distill provides a neutral platform for multiple authors to jointly publish. This is in contrast to a personal blog, where it may feel like the outside contributor gets less credit.</p>

  <p><b>Impact</b> -- Distill articles are read by tens of thousands of people.</p>

  <p><b>Archiving</b> -- Distill articles are issued DOIs and archived to ensure preservation of the academic record.</p>

  <h2>How to Submit an Article</h2>

  <p>Our preferred process is that you create a GitHub repository with your article. If it is private, please share it with <a href="https://github.com/shancarter">@colah</a> and <a href="https://github.com/shancarter">@shancarter</a>. Then email <a href="mailto:review@distill.pub">review@distill.pub</a> to begin the process. Please contact us if you require alternative accommodations.</p>

  <p>Distill articles must be prepared using our lightweight web framework -- see our <a href="distill.pub/guide/">guide</a>. Articles must also be released under the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/">Creative Commons Attribution license</a>.</p>

  <h2>Article Review</h2>

  <p>Publication in Distill is a request for hundreds of thousands of people to pay attention to your work. As such, we believe the criteria for publication should be whether your article respects that attention.</p>

  <p><b>What we review for --</b> Distill reviews for outstanding communication, scientific integrity, and respect for prior work. We do not review for novelty or importance of results, but we will review for whether it moves the research dialog forward.</p>

  <p><b>Peer Review --</b> Distill discretionally uses pre-publication review by external experts, because it has a high cost on everyone involved. We facilitate post-publication review which we think does a better job accomplishing the goals of review.</p>

  <p><b>Editorial Support --</b> Distill's editors sometimes help authors improve promising articles. They can give feedback on exposition and help refine the design of diagrams. Authors tell us that their articles were greatly improved by this editing. That said, this kind of editing is expensive, and we do not commit to doing it for every article we consider.</p>

  <p><b>Review of Editor Articles --</b> In cases where editors are authors of an article, an uninvolved reviewer is required.</p>

  <h2>Authorship</h2>

  <p>The authors should be the set of people who made substantial contributions. This includes, but is not limited to, people who ran experiments, who formulated ideas, who wrote the actual article, or who created visualizations of ideas in the article. We encourage authors to include an “Author Contributions” statement.</p>

  <p>The one exception is that journal editors may make significant contributions in revising the article and not be authors.</p>

  <h2>Ethics Concerns (eg. Plagiarism, Misconduct, etc.)</h2>

  <p>Distill takes ethics concerns very seriously. Please email <a href="mailto:ethics@distill.pub">ethics@distill.pub</a> to raise a concern, or reach out to any of Distill's editors individually if that feels more comfortable.</p>

  <p>As a young journal, Distill does not have established policies or procedures for every issue we may run into. As issues arise we’ll give consideration to the policies of journals we respect (eg. <a href="https://www.plos.org/">PLOS</a>), the recommendations of the <a href="http://publicationethics.org/">Committee on Publication Ethics</a>, community norms, and the philosophy of the Open Science movement.</p>
