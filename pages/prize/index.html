  <h1>The Distill Prize</h1>
  <h2>Recognizing outstanding work communicating and refining ideas in Machine Learning and adjacent topics.</h2>

  <hr>

  <h2>How much is the Distill Prize?</h2>

  <p>Distill prizes are expected to be $10,000 USD.</p>

  <p>The Distill Prize has a $100,000 USD initial endowment, funded by <a href="http://colah.github.io">Chris Olah</a>, <a href="https://gregbrockman.com/">Greg Brockman</a>, <a href="https://research.google.com/pubs/jeff.html">Jeff Dean</a>, <a href="https://deepmind.com/">DeepMind</a>, and the <a href="http://www.openphilanthropy.org/">Open Philanthropy Project</a>. Logistics for the prize are handled by the Open Philanthropy Project.</p>


  <h2>When are prizes given?</h2>

  <p>Distill prizes are given annually for work done before Jan 1 of that year. The number given each year depends on the amount of outstanding work done. We aim to come to decisions by Feb 30th.</p>

  <h2>What sort of work is eligible for the prize?</h2>

  <ul class="tight-list">
  <li>Tutorials and solving "open exposition problems." <dt-fn>The term "open exposition problem" was introduced by Timothy Chow in <a href="">A Beginner's Guide To Forcing</a></dt-fn></li>
  <li>Creating a new way of looking at something, reframing it or creating a new perspective.</li>
  <li>Clarifying things we formally know but donâ€™t understand.</li>
  <li>Visualizations, interfaces, or <a href="http://explorableexplanations.com/">explorable explanations</a>.</li>
  <li>Communicating novel results extremely well. </li>
  <li>Filtering and summarizing research.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Can I nominate someone?</h2>

  <p>If you'd like to make sure the prize committee is aware of someone's work, you can explicitly nominate them for the Distill Prize. To do this, send an email to <a href="mailto:prize@distill.pub">prize@distill.pub</a>. Nominations should be sent prior to Jan 1 to be considered for that year. Please include links to relevant work. People cannot nominate themselves.</p>

  <h2>How does this relate to the Distill research journal?</h2>

  <p>Being awarded a Distill Prize and being published in the Distill Journal are completely independent. The Distill Prize has no intrinsic preference for work published in its cousin journal.

  <p>The Distill Prize is legally separate from the Distill Journal, and is not funded or awarded by the Distill Journal.
