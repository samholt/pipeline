  <h1>The Distill Prize</h1>
  <h2>A yearly cash prize to recognize outstanding work communicating and refining ideas in Machine Learning and adjacent topics.</h2>

  <hr>

  <h2>How much is the Distill Prize?</h2>

  <p>Distill prizes are expected to be $10,000 USD.</p>

  <p>The Distill Prize has a $100,000 USD initial endowment, generously funded by <a href="http://colah.github.io">Chris Olah</a>, <a href="https://gregbrockman.com/">Greg Brockman</a>, <a href="https://research.google.com/pubs/jeff.html">Jeff Dean</a>, and the <a href="http://www.openphilanthropy.org/">Open Philanthropy Project</a>. Logistics for the prize are handled by the Open Philanthropy Project.</p>


  <h2>When are prizes given?</h2>

  <p>Distill prizes are given annually for work done before Jan 1 of that year. The number given each year depends on the amount of outstanding work done. We aim to come to decisions by Feb 30th.</p>

  <h2>What sort of work is eligible for the prize?</h2>

  <ul class="tight-list">
  <li>Tutorials and solving "open exposition problems." <dt-fn>The term "open exposition problem" was introduced by Timothy Chow in <a href="">A Beginner's Guide To Forcing</a></dt-fn></li>
  <li>Creating a new way of looking at something, reframing it or creating a new perspective.</li>
  <li>Clarifying things we formally know but don’t understand.</li>
  <li>Visualizations, interfaces, or <a href="http://explorableexplanations.com/">explorable explanations</a>.</li>
  <li>Communicating novel results extremely well. </li>
  <li>Filtering and summarizing research.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Can I nominate someone?</h2>

  <p>If you'd like to make sure the prize committee is aware of someone's work, you can explicitly nominate them for the Distill Prize. To do this, send an email to <a href="mailto:prize@distill.pub">prize@distill.pub</a>. Nominations should be sent prior to Jan 1 to be considered for that year. Please include links to relevant work.</p>

  <h2>How does this relate to the Distill research journal?</h2>

  <p>Acceptance into the Distill Journal is completely independent of being a Distill Prize recipient.

  <p>Since the Distill Prize acknowledges previous work, anything we acknowledge will be published prior to us deciding to give them the prize, whether in the Distill Journal or elsewhere. As such, if an author wishes to publish their work in the Distill Journal, it’s review and decisions about whether to accept it will have been made prior to considering them for the Distill Prize.

  <p>While the objectives the Distill Journal and Distill Prize are closely aligned, and we expect that any work we acknowledge with a Distill Prize would have made an outstanding fit for the Distill Journal, content being in the Distill Journal is neither necessary nor sufficient. In particular, the Distill Prize will be gladly given to work published in any venue, and has no intrinsic preference for its cousin journal. Whether a paper is published in the Distill Journal does not impact the decision.
