    <h2>Our Goals</h2>
    <p>Traditional academic publishing is rife with archaic publishing tools and byzantine incentives that ignore the needs of the reader. <br>We think there’s a better way.
    <!--
<p>By fostering a community that holds the needs of the readers above others, we aim to create research articles that are more accessible and more expressive.</p>
-->
    <p>Most novel research is not digested or "distilled" in a way that makes it approachable. We aim to prove that there is a lot of value to the entire research community in explaining things in a way that makes them easier and faster to digest. Good explanations not only save everyone time, but we also hope to open new and deeper understanding of ideas that we think we already know.
    <p>We also want to legitimize this work. It is hard work. We want to encourage others to participate by creating incentives and by giving it value.
    <p>Why Machine Learning? As machine learning changes how humans and computers interact, we think it is incredibly important to make those techniques transparent — not only so we can understand how they work, but also to make it accessible to more people.
