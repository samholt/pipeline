    <h2>New discoveries require new ways of thinking</h2>
    <p>New discoveries often require new ways of thinking to grow and flourish -- new notations, visualizations, or mental models. These mental user interfaces unlock our ability to truly engage with these ideas. Sadly, this is rarely even acknowledged. By nurturing the human dimension of research, Distill hopes to make ideas more approachable and to create fertile ground for making new discoveries. </p>

    <h2>An expressive medium for expressing ideas</h2>
    <p>The modern Web gives us powerful tools to share new ways of thinking -- to create user interfaces for our ideas. Over the last few years we've seen many incredible demonstrations of this kind of work. PDFs are so last century.</p>

  <h2>Lending a helping hand</h2>
  <p>Many researchers want to do this kind of work, but can’t get the support they need to pursue it. We, as the research community, are failing them. We don’t treat their wonderful, non-traditional research artifacts as “real” academic contributions.</p>

    <h2>Why machine learning?</h2>
    <p>Machine Learning is the biggest UI challenge -- and opportunity -- of the decade. The biggest advances in UI will be driven by problems challenges in Machine Learning. Conversely, deeply understanding machine learning, and solving problems like transparency, is deeply connected to user interface design.</p>

    <!--<h2>Our Goals</h2>
    <p>Traditional academic publishing is rife with archaic publishing tools and byzantine incentives that ignore the needs of the reader. We think there’s a better way. By fostering a community that holds the needs of the readers above others, we aim to create research articles that are more accessible and more expressive.</p>

    <p>Most novel research is not digested or "distilled" in a way that makes it approachable. We aim to prove that there is a lot of value to the entire research community in explaining things in a way that makes them easier and faster to digest. Good explanations not only save everyone time, but we also hope to open new and deeper understanding of ideas that we think we already know.
    <p>We also want to legitimize this work. It is hard work. We want to encourage others to participate by creating incentives and by giving it value.
    <p>Why Machine Learning? As machine learning changes how humans and computers interact, we think it is incredibly important to make those techniques transparent — not only so we can understand how they work, but also to make it accessible to more people.-->
